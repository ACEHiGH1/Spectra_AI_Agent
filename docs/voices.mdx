# Voice Basics

Vocode supports several different TTS models, giving you maximum flexibility and control
over the voice of your agents. Our current list of supported model providers is:

- [Play.ht](https://play.ht)
- [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io)
- [Rime](https://rime.ai)
- [Azure](https://azure.com)

## Vocode curated voices

Choosing a voice isn't easy, so the Vocode team has curated a list of voices that we think are the best
across the different providers and use cases. These can be found here:

We also are compatible with any stock voice from our provider list. You can reach us on Slack and we can add it to our
voice list.

## Voice clones

For enterprise customers, we can add cloned voices on a case-by-case basis. Please reach out to us on Slack if you'd like
to explore custom cloned voices.
